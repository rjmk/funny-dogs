# Reducks

## What if you could look at GIFs of funny ducks?
## What if you could live in a world of pure functions and centralised, immutable state?
# What if REDUCKS?

Redux is a small module that helps in building [Elm Architecture](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/) apps.
One's app can be considered as a function from the current state and an action to a new state.
It comes with a library of React bindings, which I reckon we'll use.
We're going to try and use it to build a gif viewer for funny ducks.
